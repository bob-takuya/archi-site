- [ ] Results relevant to architecture
- [ ] Japanese text displayed correctly
- [ ] No encoding issues
- [ ] Number of results: ____
- [ ] Performance acceptable

#### Test Case 3: Tokyo Location Search (東京)
**Input**: 東京
**Expected Result**:
- Results should show architectural works located in Tokyo
- Geographic filtering should work with Japanese place names

**Test Steps**:
1. Clear search field
2. Enter "東京"
3. Submit search
4. Verify results are Tokyo-related

**Document**:
- [ ] Search successful
- [ ] Results geo-filtered correctly

4. Check mixed language handling

**Document**:
- [ ] Mixed input accepted
- [ ] Search executed without errors
- [ ] Results include mixed language matches
- [ ] Character switching handled properly
- [ ] Relevant results for Tokyo Tower: ____

#### Test Case 5: Rapid Japanese Input Test
**Input**: Multiple rapid searches with Japanese characters
**Test Sequence**:
- 安藤忠雄 → 建築 → 東京 → 現代建築 → 伝統建築

**Expected Result**:
- System should handle rapid input changes
- No lag or freezing with Japanese IME
- Search debouncing should work properly

**Test Steps**:
1. Perform rapid sequential searches
2. Monitor system responsiveness
3. Check for memory leaks or performance degradation
4. Verify each search completes correctly

**Document**:
- [ ] All rapid searches completed
- [ ] No system lag or freezing
- [ ] Japanese IME responsive throughout
- [ ] Search debouncing working
- [ ] Performance degradation: Yes/No

### Console Error Monitoring

**Required Browser Dev Tools Checks**:
1. Open Developer Console (F12)
2. Monitor for errors during each test case
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Look for character encoding warnings

**Common Issues to Watch For**:
- UTF-8 encoding errors
- Failed AJAX requests with Japanese parameters
- JavaScript errors when processing Japanese text
- URL encoding issues with Japanese characters
- Database query errors with multi-byte characters

### Expected Error Patterns:
```
❌ Encoding Error: "UnicodeDecodeError" or similar
❌ Network Error: 400/500 errors with Japanese query params
❌ JavaScript Error: "Invalid character" exceptions
❌ Search Error: Empty results when they should exist
```

### Performance Benchmarks:
- Search response time should be < 2 seconds
- Japanese character input should be immediate
- Results should load progressively if large dataset
- No memory leaks during rapid searches

### Accessibility Testing:
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility with Japanese text
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works with IME
- [ ] Search suggestions (if any) support Japanese
- [ ] Mobile touch input works with Japanese keyboard

### Cross-Browser Compatibility:
- [ ] Chrome: Japanese search functionality
- [ ] Firefox: Japanese search functionality  
- [ ] Safari: Japanese search functionality
- [ ] Mobile browsers: Japanese input methods

### Final Test Report Template:
