# Architects Database Issue Analysis Report

## Issue Summary
The architects tab on https://bob-takuya.github.io/archi-site/#/architects is experiencing a "ge is not a function" error during sql.js-httpvfs initialization, preventing the display of 2927 architects from the ZCDARCHITECT table.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Configuration Mismatch
- **Expected**: The code references `archimap.sqlite` in multiple places
- **Actual**: The database configuration file (`database-info.json`) correctly points to `archimap.sqlite`
- **Status**: âœ… Configuration appears correct

### 2. Module Bundling Issue (MOST LIKELY CAUSE)
The error "ge is not a function" is characteristic of:
- **Minification problems**: A function name has been mangled during the build process
- **Module transformation**: Vite's bundling of sql.js-httpvfs may be causing issues
- **Evidence**: 
  - sql.js-httpvfs is included in `manualChunks` configuration
  - The error occurs in production but works locally
  - The function name "ge" is unusually short, suggesting minification

### 3. Architecture vs Architects Implementation Differences
- **Architecture Tab**: Works correctly with the same database setup
- **Architects Tab**: Fails with initialization error
- **Key Difference**: The implementation approach might differ between the two tabs

## Technical Findings

### Database Structure
```sql
Table: ZCDARCHITECT
- Contains 2927 architect records
- Fields include: ZAT_ID, ZAT_ARCHITECT, ZAT_ARCHITECT_JP, ZAT_ARCHITECT_EN, etc.
- Properly indexed for performance
```

### Initialization Flow
1. ClientDatabaseService attempts chunked loading with sql.js-httpvfs
2. On failure, it falls back to direct SQL.js loading
3. The error occurs during the sql.js-httpvfs initialization phase

### Configuration Details
- Chunk size: 64KB (65536 bytes)
- Total chunks: 195
- Database size: 12.73 MB
- Request pattern: HTTP Range requests for efficient loading

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Immediate Fix - Force Direct Loading
Modify `ClientDatabaseService.ts` to skip sql.js-httpvfs for the architects page:
```typescript
// Add condition to skip chunked loading for architects
if (window.location.hash.includes('/architects')) {
    useChunked = false;
}
```

### 2. Proper Fix - Resolve Bundling Issue
Update `vite.config.ts` to handle sql.js-httpvfs correctly:
```typescript
optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['sql.js', 'sql.js-httpvfs'], // Exclude both from optimization
},
build: {
    rollupOptions: {
        external: ['sql.js-httpvfs'], // Keep as external module
    }
}
```

### 3. Alternative - Use Same Approach as Architecture Tab
Compare and align the database initialization approach between architecture and architects tabs.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Local Testing**: Use the test HTML file created to verify database access
2. **Build Testing**: Test with production build locally before deployment
3. **Module Testing**: Verify sql.js-httpvfs module loading independently

## Next Steps

1. Apply immediate fix to unblock users
2. Investigate exact minification issue in bundled code
3. Consider updating sql.js-httpvfs to latest version (current: 0.8.12)
4. Implement consistent database loading across all tabs

## Additional Notes

- The database file and configuration are correctly set up
- The issue is specific to the production build, not the database itself
- GitHub Pages GZIP handling doesn't appear to be the issue
- The fallback mechanism to direct SQL.js should work if properly triggered
