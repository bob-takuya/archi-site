# Search Failure Documentation - Navigation State Issues

**TESTER Agent Report**: Documentation of search failures related to navigation state

**Test Environment**: Playwright E2E Testing

## Search Failure Patterns by Navigation State

### 1. ❌ Search After Initial Page Load
**Navigation Pattern**: Direct page access → Immediate search attempt  
**Failure Mode**: Timeout and data loading race condition  
**Root Cause**: 
```javascript
// Console errors observed:
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
❌ Failed to load page 39: TypeError: Failed to fetch
初期データ取得エラー: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**When Search Fails**:
- When user searches before data fetching completes
- When background API calls return 404 errors
- When React components are still mounting/loading

**Impact**: Search input accepts text but results don't load, creating user confusion

---

### 2. ❌ Search After Route Navigation
**Navigation Pattern**: Home page → Navigate to `/architecture` → Attempt search  
**Failure Mode**: 404 Route Not Found  
**Root Cause**: Expected routes don't exist in current implementation

**Affected Routes**:
- `/architecture` → 404 Not Found
- `/architect` → 404 Not Found  
- `/map` → 404 Not Found

**When Search Fails**:
- User navigates to any route other than home page (`/`)
- Search functionality completely unavailable on 404 pages
- No fallback or redirect to working search page

**Impact**: Complete loss of search functionality on primary application routes

---

### 3. ❌ Search After Component Interaction
**Navigation Pattern**: Page load → Click UI elements → Attempt search  
**Failure Mode**: Search state reset or component re-render issues  
**Root Cause**: State management problems during component lifecycle

**Trigger Interactions**:
- Clicking buttons on the page
- Switching view modes (if available)
- Interacting with navigation elements

**When Search Fails**:
- After button clicks that trigger component re-renders
- When state management doesn't properly preserve search context
- During component unmount/remount cycles

**Error Pattern**:
```
locator.fill: Timeout 10000ms exceeded
waiting for locator('input').first()
```

**Impact**: Search input becomes unavailable or unresponsive after user interactions

---

### 4. ❌ Search During Data Loading States
**Navigation Pattern**: Page access → Search while loading → Continued interaction  
**Failure Mode**: Search functionality blocked by loading states  
**Root Cause**: No proper loading state management

**When Search Fails**:
- During initial data fetch operations
- When API calls are pending
- When components are in loading/suspended state

**Observable Behavior**:
- Search input may be disabled or unresponsive
- Loading spinners block user interaction
- No indication when search will become available

**Impact**: Users cannot search until all background operations complete

---

### 5. ⚠️ Search After Sort/Filter Operations  
**Navigation Pattern**: Page load → Apply sorting → Search  
**Failure Mode**: Feature not implemented  
**Root Cause**: Missing sorting and filtering functionality

**Expected but Missing Elements**:
- Material-UI Select components for sorting
- Filter chips and controls
- Pagination components

**When Search Fails**:
- Tests expect sorting controls that don't exist
- Advanced search features not implemented
- Simple search input doesn't support complex operations

**Impact**: Advanced search workflows are completely unavailable

---

### 6. ❌ Search in Mobile/Responsive Contexts
**Navigation Pattern**: Mobile device → Navigation → Search attempt  
**Failure Mode**: Touch interaction and responsive layout issues  
**Root Cause**: Mobile-specific implementation gaps

**Mobile-Specific Failures**:
- Touch events not properly handled
- Responsive search interface issues
- Keyboard behavior problems on mobile devices

**Impact**: Search unreliable on mobile devices

## Critical Navigation State Dependencies

### State Management Failures
1. **URL State**: Hash routing works but conflicts with data loading
2. **Component State**: Search state lost during navigation transitions
3. **Global State**: No centralized search state management
4. **Local Storage**: Search history/preferences not persisted

### Data Layer Dependencies
1. **API Availability**: Search depends on backend services that return 404
2. **Data Initialization**: Search blocked until data fetching completes
3. **Error Recovery**: No fallback when data services fail

### UI State Dependencies  
1. **Component Mounting**: Search unavailable during mount/unmount
2. **Loading States**: No search interaction during loading
3. **Error Boundaries**: Search failures crash components

## Specific Failure Scenarios Documented

### Scenario A: Fast Navigation + Search
```typescript
// User behavior that causes failure:
1. Navigate to page
2. Immediately start typing in search
3. Press Enter before page fully loads
Result: Search appears to work but no results load
```

### Scenario B: Route-Based Search Access
```typescript
// URL patterns that fail:
Direct access to: /architecture, /architect, /map
Result: 404 error, no search functionality available
```

### Scenario C: Multiple Rapid Searches
```typescript
// Rapid search sequence:
Search "term1" → Search "term2" → Search "term3" (within seconds)
Result: State conflicts, inconsistent results, UI lag
```

### Scenario D: Navigation-Search-Navigation Loop
```typescript
// Navigation loop that breaks search:
Home → Click button → Search → Navigate away → Return → Search
Result: Search state reset, previous search lost
```

## Error Patterns and Root Causes

### Data Fetching Race Conditions
```javascript
// Common error pattern:
async componentDidMount() {
  // Search component mounts
  this.setState({ searchReady: false });
  
  try {
    await fetchData(); // This fails with 404
    this.setState({ searchReady: true });
  } catch (error) {
    // Search remains unavailable
    console.error('Data fetch failed:', error);
  }
}
```

### Router Configuration Issues
```javascript
// Expected routes not configured:
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: HomePage },
  // Missing: { path: '/architecture', component: ArchitecturePage },
  // Missing: { path: '/architect', component: ArchitectPage },
  // Missing: { path: '/map', component: MapPage },
];
```

### State Management Problems
```javascript
// Search state not properly managed:
const SearchComponent = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(''); // Local state only
  
  // Problem: State lost on navigation
  // Problem: No persistence across components
  // Problem: No global search context
};
```

## Recommendations for Navigation State Fixes

### Immediate Fixes (Critical)
1. **Add Error Boundaries**: Prevent search failures from crashing the app
2. **Implement Missing Routes**: Add proper routing for all search pages
3. **Fix Data Loading**: Resolve 404 errors in data fetching

### State Management Improvements
1. **Global Search Context**: Implement React Context for search state
2. **URL State Sync**: Ensure search state always syncs with URL
3. **Persistence**: Store search state in localStorage for session recovery

### User Experience Enhancements
1. **Loading States**: Show clear loading indicators during data fetch
2. **Error Fallbacks**: Provide meaningful error messages and recovery options
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Allow basic search even when advanced features fail

### Testing Strategy Updates
1. **Mock Data Layer**: Use Playwright mocking to test without backend dependencies
2. **Navigation-Specific Tests**: Create tests for each navigation pattern
3. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Test search behavior during various failure modes
