# 🗺️ Interactive Map Integration & Enhanced Visualizations

## Overview
The Japanese Architecture Database now features **fully interactive visualizations** in the Research tab and **integrated map view** in the Architecture browsing tab, creating a comprehensive spatial and analytical exploration experience.

## 🎯 New Features Implemented

### 1. **Fully Interactive Research Visualizations** (`研究` Tab)
All charts and visualizations are now clickable and interactive:

#### 📊 **Interactive Charts**
- **Bar Chart (時代別建築数)**: Click any bar to filter by that decade
- **Pie Chart (建物種別分布)**: Click any slice to see all buildings of that category
- **Line Chart (建築史時代変遷)**: Click any point to explore that time period

#### 🔗 **Enhanced Click Interactions**
- **All text elements**: Decades, categories, prefectures are clickable
- **Visual feedback**: Hover states on all interactive elements
- **Seamless navigation**: Every click takes you to filtered results in 建築作品 tab

### 2. **Map View Integration** (`建築作品` Tab)
Replaced list view with a powerful map visualization:

#### 🗺️ **Toggle Between Views**
- **Card View** (カードビュー): Traditional grid layout with building cards
- **Map View** (マップビュー): Interactive map showing building locations

#### 📍 **Map Features**
- **Smart Clustering**: Groups nearby buildings for clarity
- **Auto-centering**: Map automatically centers on filtered results
- **Dynamic Zoom**: Adjusts zoom level based on filter scope
- **Location Count**: Shows how many buildings have coordinates
- **Click Navigation**: Click any marker to view building details

#### 🎯 **Intelligent Map Behavior**
- **Filtered View**: When filtering (e.g., by architect), map centers on those results
- **Default View**: Shows all of Japan when no filters applied
- **Missing Coordinates**: Indicates when some buildings can't be mapped
- **Performance**: Loads up to 50 buildings at once for smooth interaction

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**

#### 🔄 **Seamless Flow Between Tabs**
```
研究 Tab → Click any visualization → 建築作品 Tab (Filtered) → Toggle to Map View
         ↓                                                    ↓
    See analytics                                    See spatial distribution
```

#### 📊 **Research Insights Sidebar**
- Remains visible in both Card and Map views
- Provides context while exploring spatially
- Quick filters for instant map updates

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Visualization Interactivity
- **Recharts Event Handlers**: Added onClick events to all chart components
- **Cursor Feedback**: All interactive elements show pointer cursor
- **Navigation Logic**: Each click generates appropriate filter URLs

### Map Integration
- **View Mode State**: `useState<'grid' | 'map'>('grid')`
- **Conditional Rendering**: Switches between card grid and map component
- **Marker Generation**: Filters buildings with valid coordinates
- **Smart Centering**: Calculates center based on visible markers

### Performance Optimizations
- **Pagination Adjustment**: 12 items for card view, 50 for map view
- **Coordinate Filtering**: Only passes buildings with lat/lng to map
- **Lazy Loading**: Map component loads only when selected

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Time Period Exploration
1. Go to 研究 tab → 時代変遷
2. Click "1960年代" on the line chart
3. Automatically see all 1960s buildings in 建築作品
4. Toggle to Map View to see their geographic distribution

### Example 2: Category Analysis
1. In 研究 tab → Overview
2. Click "美術館" slice in the pie chart
3. View all museums in card view
4. Switch to Map View to see museum locations across Japan

### Example 3: Regional Discovery
1. Click "東京都" in regional analysis
2. See Tokyo buildings in card view
3. Toggle to Map View for neighborhood clustering
4. Use insights sidebar to filter by architect or category

### Example 4: Award Winner Mapping
1. Click any award in 研究 tab
2. View award-winning buildings
3. Switch to Map View to see geographic distribution of excellence

## 🗺️ Map View Features

### Visual Elements
- **Blue Markers**: Standard building locations
- **Clustered Numbers**: Groups of nearby buildings
- **Popup Info**: Building name, architect, year, category
- **Zoom Controls**: Standard map navigation

### Smart Behaviors
- **Auto-fit**: Adjusts view to show all filtered markers
- **Preserve Position**: Maintains map position when toggling filters
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly on all devices

## 📈 Benefits

### For Researchers
- **Spatial Analysis**: Understand geographic patterns in architecture
- **Time-Space Correlation**: See how architecture spread geographically over time
- **Regional Styles**: Identify architectural trends by location

### For Casual Users
- **Visual Discovery**: Explore architecture through maps
- **Neighborhood Exploration**: Find buildings near each other
- **Travel Planning**: Plan architecture tours by location

## 🌐 Live Implementation
