## Key Monitoring Capabilities

### Network Activity Tracking
1. **API Request Monitoring**:
   - All HTTP requests made during search operations
   - Request headers, methods, and parameters
   - Request timing and sequencing

2. **Failed Request Detection**:
   - HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes
   - Network timeout errors
   - Cancelled requests
   - Connection failures

3. **Request Timing Analysis**:
   - Response time measurement
   - Average response time calculation
   - Performance threshold monitoring
   - Slow request identification

4. **Duplicate Request Identification**:
   - Automatic detection of redundant requests
   - Request deduplication analysis
   - Performance impact assessment

5. **Response Data Structure Validation**:
   - JSON response parsing and validation
   - API response structure verification
   - Data integrity checking

### Search-Specific Monitoring

1. **Global Search API** (`globalSearch` function):
   - Multi-table search monitoring
   - Response caching validation
   - Query parameter analysis

2. **Tag-Based Search** (`searchByTag` function):
   - Pagination monitoring
   - Filter application tracking
   - Result set validation

3. **Full-Text Search** (`fullTextSearch` function):
   - Complex query performance
   - Relevance scoring validation
   - Search term handling

4. **Database Operations**:
   - SQLite query execution monitoring
   - Database loading verification
   - WASM and Worker file loading

## Performance Metrics

The monitoring system tracks critical performance indicators:

- **Response Time**: < 2000ms average (configurable threshold)
- **Error Rate**: < 5% failure rate
- **Request Frequency**: Optimal request-per-search ratios
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Effectiveness of caching mechanisms
- **Duplicate Count**: Minimal redundant requests
