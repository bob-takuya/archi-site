## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Enhanced search indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_architecture_search ON ZCDARCHITECTURE (ZAR_TITLE, ZAR_ARCHITECT, ZAR_PREFECTURE);
CREATE INDEX idx_architecture_year ON ZCDARCHITECTURE (ZAR_YEAR);

-- Full-text search implementation
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE architecture_fts USING fts5(
    title, architect, description, tags, prefecture,
    content='ZCDARCHITECTURE',
    content_rowid='Z_PK'
);
```

### Mobile-First Component System
```typescript
// Touch-optimized component with haptic feedback
const TouchOptimizedButton: React.FC<TouchOptimizedButtonProps> = ({
  hapticFeedback = true,
  ...props
}) => {
  const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    if (hapticFeedback && 'vibrate' in navigator) {
      navigator.vibrate(50);
    }
    onClick?.(e);
  };
  // Implementation details...
};
```

### Smart Caching Architecture
```typescript
export class SmartCachingService {
  private cache = new Map<string, CacheEntry>();
  
  async get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
    // Intelligent cache management with TTL and LRU eviction
  }
  
  async set<T>(key: string, data: T, ttl: number): Promise<void> {
    // Performance-optimized caching with memory management
  }
}
```
