# Map View Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Added View Mode Toggle (List/Grid/Map)
- Added List view option to the existing Grid and Map views
- Updated toggle button group with three options
- Added ListIcon import for the list view button

### 2. Integrated Map Component
- Map component was already integrated
- Enhanced with marker clustering support using leaflet.markercluster
- Improved popup information display

### 3. Filter Integration
- All existing filters (search, category, prefecture, year) work seamlessly with map view
- Filtered architecture data is passed to the map component
- Map auto-centers based on filtered markers

### 4. Marker Clustering
- Implemented marker clustering for performance with 14,000+ points
- Uses leaflet.markercluster library (already installed)
- Configured with:
  - maxClusterRadius: 50
  - spiderfyOnMaxZoom: true
  - chunkedLoading: true for better performance

### 5. Popup/Info Windows
- Enhanced popups show:
  - Architecture title
  - Architect name
  - Completion year
  - Category
  - Awards/tags (in orange color)
  - Location/address
  - Link to detailed view

### 6. State Maintenance
- View mode state is maintained when switching between views
- Pagination adjusts based on view mode:

  - Map view: 50 items (no pagination, all on map)

### 7. Loading States
- Added appropriate skeleton loaders for each view:
  - List view: Text skeletons
  - Grid view: Card skeletons
  - Map view: Rectangular skeleton

## File Changes

1. **src/pages/ArchitecturePage.tsx**
   - Updated view mode state to include 'list'
   - Added List view implementation with detailed item display
   - Modified pagination to work correctly with all views
   - Updated loading skeletons for all three views

2. **src/components/Map.tsx**
   - Added marker clustering support
   - Enhanced marker popup content
   - Improved TypeScript types for architecture data
   - Added auto-centering based on markers
   - Fixed navigation links in popups

## Usage

Users can now switch between three views:
- **List View**: Detailed list with all information visible
- **Grid View**: Card-based layout for visual browsing
- **Map View**: Geographic visualization with clustering

All filters and search functionality work across all three views, maintaining a consistent user experience.
