- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design

### 2. **ArchitecturePage Integration**
- Seamless toggle between Grid/List/Map views
- All filters work consistently across views
- Increased item loading for map view (100 items)
- Navigation to detail pages from map markers
- View mode persistence

### 3. **Comprehensive E2E Tests**
- 10+ test cases covering all requirements
- Performance benchmarks with 500+ markers
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Accessibility compliance checks
